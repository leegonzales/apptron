This would enable native 64-bit binaries like Gemini CLI, Bun, etc.\n\nKey steps:\n1. Build AI agent Docker image (Dockerfile.ai-agent in UPGRADE_PROPOSAL.md)\n2. Convert to WASM using c2w\n3. Modify boot.go to load container2wasm instead of/alongside v86\n4. Wire up networking via existing WebSocket bridge\n\nResources:\n- https://github.com/ktock/container2wasm\n- UPGRADE_PROPOSAL.md has detailed implementation plan","design":"Replace v86 32-bit emulation with container2wasm for 64-bit Docker container support.
